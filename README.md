A solution for food recipe data handling. A portfolio project, scalable, DRY and SOLID.  

The main purpose of this project is to showcase my current level or "skill" regarding ASP.NET API, the SOLID principles, SQL and the general workflow and project management.

Currently the sollution contains:  
-ASP.Net Core API project  
-a Class Library for the API  
-A SQL Database project  


The published database is not included in the project you will have to publish your own database from the SQL Project.  

Also use /swagger as that's the main UI for the project where the endpoints are accessible. UIs are outside the scope of this project. 

There is no data validation implemented yet, but I'm working on it.
